1.Clicking anywhere on the map will cause a nuke to spawn at a random Y-location which will fall and explode on the nearest blacksmith (which has been replaced with a "Nuclear Reactor."
The area around where the mouse has clicked will also cause a radiation zone to appear.

2.When the nuke lands, an explosion (Fireball Entity) will appear destroying anything caught within its blast. In the wake of the explosion, the background will change
to either a Smoulder or a new FiendSpawner entity will spawn. These entities will now spawn new Egg entities which hatch into demons which actively hunt down all miners.
Once all miners are gone, they will hunt down the SuperMiners

As for the radiation zones, any miner's that are directly in the radiation zone when it intially appears will be transformed into SuperMiners with new activity

3.Blobs are effectively out of the world
Once transformed, SuperMiners will actively hunt down and kill demons as they spawn into the world.

4. The new entities are:
Nuke,
Fireball,
FiendSpawner,
Egg,
Demon

Nuke: Nukes, when spawned will go to the nearest reactor (blacksmith) and explode spawning multiple Fireball entities.
Fireball: Fireballs are just like quakes. They destroy any entities that are in the square that they spawn in, and they change the background to a smoulder or spawn a 
fiend spawner upon despawning.
FiendSpawner: Spawners act just as veins do. They have a 20% chance of spawning from a Fireball and spawn eggs around themselves. These eggs hatch into demons
Egg: Just as an ore, except miners do not pick these up. After a certain amount of time, a demon will spawn.
Demon: Demons actively hunt down all miners until all normal miners (MinerFull and Miner_Not_Full) are gone. Once this happens, they will hunt down all of the SuperMiners.
